   - The purpose of Tank Wars is for two players to fight till the end. A player emerges as victorious when the lives of their opponent have run out.
   - Each player has 2 lives, and will respawn until they have no more lives(at which point the game is over). 
   - PowerUps can be found within the eyes and mouth of the humanoid wall structure which is at the center of the map.
   - There are two types of walls(breakable and unbreakable); all walls not surrounding the entire game map are breakable and will destruct when shot by 2 bullets.
   - There are 2 types of PowerUps: SpeedBoost and Health; the SpeedBoost PowerUp will boost a player's speed for a total of 5 seconds while the Health PowerUp will 
     fully replenish a player's health.
